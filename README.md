JavaPad - By OliwierJ

This is a verion of the wordpad app everyone knows and loves, however created by me in Java
The program uses the Java Swing and AWX libraries to create the GUI elements seen in the program

Most basic functions of notepad are included, for example:
  - Make new files, save files, open .txt files
  - Copy, paste, cut, and select all
  - Word wrap if you dont want to have to scroll
  - Current line and column position, including no. of characters in file

To use the program you can turn the .java file into an .exe file using third-party software,
or simply run the .java file in any JDK to create and execute the .class file

I got the idea for this project while experimenting with Java's Swing GUI libraries, and found 
this project idea as a fun challenge to try complete. Overall the project was very fun to create 
and I learned a lot about Java and especially object oriented programming as the GUI libraries are 
all built upon inheritence and implementations

I used a lot of very useful resources while working on this project that I will link below.
